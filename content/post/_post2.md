After we had built up and operated the coffee house the last four years, we sold it this Spring.

The whole story began in 2017, when four gymnastique friends had the idea to open up a coffe house in the city of Zurich. Why? None of the founders knows exactly anymore. None of us had operated a coffe house before. But because action is better than words, we founded the company in 2018 and started looking for a suited location. The end result was the Nelly's Quartierkafi close to Hardbrücke in Kreis 4.

The coffee house was named after Nelly, the grandmother of Lukas. She was not only famous for her kindness of heart, but also for her baking and cooking skills. Well, maybe not quite, but at least in a small village called Oberhasli. Nelly knew that the best way to a person's heart is through food and drink there was always a place at her dining table. Our Nelly's was representative of this hospitality.

We operated the Nelly's non-profit as a social project. Every person working at the Nelly's, was it us a co-founders our our staff, was called a Nelly. Together the Nellys formed a community of energetic young and young-at-heart Nellys. We all worked at Nelly's as a balance to our "normal lives" - to promote social exchange in the neighbourhood, but also simply to have a good time together. Our motto was "Praktisch e Familie", inspired by the Swiss german TV series [Fascht e Familie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascht_e_Familie).

We called the Nelly's our "side project", but in fact it took a bit junk of our time and energy. Everything at the Nelly's was self-made, from the licensing, the interior, the furniture to the food and drinks - mostly local products from the "Zürcher Unterland". A single affair of the heart. It was a meeting place for everyone to escape the hectic everyday life from time to time. The people liked it. We had a 5 star Google review and were featured as a [HelloZurich Lieblingsort](https://www.hellozurich.ch/en/location/lieblingsort-nellys.html).

So why did we decide to sell? First of all, the two mandatory shutdowns of the Swiss gastronomie during the Covid waves were not good for business. Since we openend the Nelly's too late, we were not eligible for any government subsidies. Therefore, we had to use our cash flow buffers for continuous payments of overhead costs. Since we operated the Nelly's only as a side business, we decided not to take on any more risk by adding credit to the balance sheet. In addition, none of us wanted to change the business model of the Nelly's. We all worked part times at the Nelly's next to our jobs (in my case my doctoral studies) and operated it only four days a week. What could have worked in normal times, was not enough to cover costs over these two special years. But a major reason was also because we could sell it. We had multiple offers to buy our location.

The Nelly's is now called [Kafi Hardi](https://www.kafihardi.ch/). Even though the new owners gave the locality their own touch, if you look closely you can still see many of the details and features we built for Nelly's. Overall, we have a lot of good memories of the Nelly's. It was a unique experience that deepened our friendship and taught us many new skills - from various craft skills, to gastro licensing, to operational skills such as finance and management. But most important, it was a lot of fun. We will miss it, especially the community and friends that supported our vision of Nelly's. Bye bye Nelly's.

<!--Das Nelly’s - Das etwas andere Quartier-Kafi
S’Grosi Nelly war nicht nur für ihre Herzensgüte, sondern auch für ihre Back- und Kochkünste weltweit berühmt. Naja vielleicht nicht ganz, aber zumindest in einem kleinen Dorf namens Oberhasli. Zu jeder Zeit wurde man beim Nelly umsorgt und es gab immer einen Platz am Esstisch. Nelly wusste, dass der beste Weg zum Herzen eines Menschen über das Essen und Trinken führt. Unser Nelly’s steht nun stellvertretend für diese Gastfreundschaft. Wir sind nicht nur ein Café, sondern eine Gemeinschaft aus energiegeladenen Jungen und Jung-gebliebenen - den Nellys. Wir sind herzliche Gemüter mit unverkennbaren Charakteren, geprägt von etlichen Lebensgeschichten und stets für einen «Schwatz» zu haben. Alles in allem sind wir ein bunter Haufen. Doch eines haben wir gemeinsam, wir machen dem Namen «Nelly» alle Ehre.Bei uns ist alles echt. Von den Nellys, über die Gastfreundschaft, bis hin zu der eigens kreierten Einrichtung - eine einzige Herzensangelegenheit. Es soll ein Treffpunkt für alle sein, um dem hektischen Alltag von Zeit zu Zeit zu entfliehen.Klingt gut? Wir freuen uns immer über Besuch an der Hohlstrasse 355.

Die Nellys - Praktisch e Familie
Wir sind vier Turnerfreunde, welche mit dem Nelly’s nicht nur ein Café, sondern eine Gemeinschaft aus energiegeladenen Jungen und jung-gebliebenen Nellys gründeten. Wir arbeiten im Nelly’s als Ausgleich zu unserem «normalen Leben» - um den sozialen Austausch im Quartier zu fördern, aber auch einfach um gemeinsam eine gute Zeit zu verbringen. Praktisch e Familie halt…-->
