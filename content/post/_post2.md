We sold our coffeehouse after building it and running it for four years.

The whole story started in 2017, when four gymnastics friends had the idea to open a coffeehouse in the city of Zurich. Because actions speak louder than words, we founded the company in 2018 and started looking for a suitable location. Why? We just wanted to do a cool project together. None of us had ever run a coffeehouse before. The result was Nelly’s Quartierkafi near Hardbrücke in the 4th district.

The coffeehouse was named after Nelly, Lukas' grandmother. She was not only famous for her kindness, but also for her baking and cooking skills. Well, maybe not quite, but at least in a small village called Oberhasli. Nelly knew that the best way to a person's heart was through food and drink, and there was always a place at her table. Our Nelly's was representative of that hospitality.

We operated Nelly's non-profit as a social project. Each person who worked at Nelly's was called a Nelly. Together, the Nellys formed a community of energetic young and young-at-heart Nellys. We all worked at Nelly's as a balance to our "normal lives" - to promote social interaction in the neighborhood, but also just to have a good time together. Our motto was "Praktisch e Familie", inspired by the Swiss-German TV series [Fascht e Familie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascht_e_Familie).

We called the Nelly’s our “side project”, but it really took a lot of time and energy. Everything at Nelly's was homemade, from the licensing, the interior, the furniture, to the food and drinks - mostly local products from the area where we grew up. It was a labor of love. It was a meeting place for everyone to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Customers liked it. We had a 5-star Google review and were featured as a [HelloZurich Lieblingsort](https://www.hellozurich.ch/en/location/lieblingsort-nellys.html).

So why did we decide to sell? The two mandatory closures of Swiss restaurants during the Covid waves were not good for business. And since we operated Nelly’s as a side project, we decided not to take on more risk by adding more debt to the balance sheet. Also, none of us wanted to change the business model; we all worked part-time at Nelly’s and did not want to compromise on our day jobs. But a big reason was that selling was an option in the first place. We had several offers for our location.

Nelly's is now called [Kafi Hardi](https://www.kafihardi.ch/). Although the new owners have added their own touches to the place, if you look closely, you can still see many of the details and features we built for Nelly's. Overall, we have many fond memories. It was a unique experience that deepened our friendships and taught us new skills - from various trades, to restaurant licensing, to operational skills. Most importantly, it was a lot of fun. We will miss it, especially the community and friends who supported our vision of Nelly's. Thank you all and bye bye Nelly's.

<!--Das Nelly’s - Das etwas andere Quartier-Kafi
S’Grosi Nelly war nicht nur für ihre Herzensgüte, sondern auch für ihre Back- und Kochkünste weltweit berühmt. Naja vielleicht nicht ganz, aber zumindest in einem kleinen Dorf namens Oberhasli. Zu jeder Zeit wurde man beim Nelly umsorgt und es gab immer einen Platz am Esstisch. Nelly wusste, dass der beste Weg zum Herzen eines Menschen über das Essen und Trinken führt. Unser Nelly’s steht nun stellvertretend für diese Gastfreundschaft. Wir sind nicht nur ein Café, sondern eine Gemeinschaft aus energiegeladenen Jungen und Jung-gebliebenen - den Nellys. Wir sind herzliche Gemüter mit unverkennbaren Charakteren, geprägt von etlichen Lebensgeschichten und stets für einen «Schwatz» zu haben. Alles in allem sind wir ein bunter Haufen. Doch eines haben wir gemeinsam, wir machen dem Namen «Nelly» alle Ehre.Bei uns ist alles echt. Von den Nellys, über die Gastfreundschaft, bis hin zu der eigens kreierten Einrichtung - eine einzige Herzensangelegenheit. Es soll ein Treffpunkt für alle sein, um dem hektischen Alltag von Zeit zu Zeit zu entfliehen.Klingt gut? Wir freuen uns immer über Besuch an der Hohlstrasse 355.

Die Nellys - Praktisch e Familie
Wir sind vier Turnerfreunde, welche mit dem Nelly’s nicht nur ein Café, sondern eine Gemeinschaft aus energiegeladenen Jungen und jung-gebliebenen Nellys gründeten. Wir arbeiten im Nelly’s als Ausgleich zu unserem «normalen Leben» - um den sozialen Austausch im Quartier zu fördern, aber auch einfach um gemeinsam eine gute Zeit zu verbringen. Praktisch e Familie halt…-->
