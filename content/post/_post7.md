We propose criteria for the adoption of dfab technology in construction.

<!--more-->

The paper presents relevant criteria and a framework to match technology capabilities of digital fabrication and user needs in the technology adoption process, using state-of-the-art developments of digital fabrication with concrete (DFC) at the NCCR dfab at ETH Zurich.

The work started as a master project of Fabian Seiler and Roman Wüst, and was subsequently refined and improved led by Konrad Graser during his PhD work in collaboration with Alexander Walzer, René Jähne, Daniel Hall, and myself.

"Qualitative technology evaluation of digital fabrication with concrete: Conceptual framework and scoreboard" is now available open-access here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926580523002248"><i class="ai ai-open-access"></i> Automation in Construction</a>.
