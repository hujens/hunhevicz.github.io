We propose criteria for the adoption of dfab technology in construction.

<!--more-->

The paper presents relevant criteria and a framework for matching the technological capabilities of digital fabrication with the needs of users in the technology adoption process, using the latest developments in Digital Fabrication with Concrete (DFC) at the NCCR dfab at ETH Zurich.

The work began as a master's project by Fabian Seiler and Roman Wüst, and was subsequently refined and improved under the direction of Konrad Graser during his Ph.D. work, in collaboration with Alexander Walzer, René Jähne, Daniel Hall, and myself.

"Qualitative technology evaluation of digital fabrication with concrete: Conceptual framework and scoreboard" is now available open-access here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926580523002248"><i class="ai ai-open-access"></i> Automation in Construction</a>.
