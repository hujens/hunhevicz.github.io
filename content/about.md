I am a  postdoctoral researcher at Empa and ETH Zurich. I work with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cea.ibi.ethz.ch/people/catherine_de_wolf.html">Catherine de Wolf</a> in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cea.ibi.ethz.ch/">Circular Engineering for Architecture Group</a>, and with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sustec.ethz.ch/people/affiliates0/gmavromatidis.html">Georgios Mavromatidis</a> (former <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bpi.tuwien.ac.at/bpi/team/">Kristina Orehounig</a>) in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.empa.ch/web/s313">Urban Energy Systems Laboratory</a>.

I am interested in interdisciplinary research between the built environment and digitalization, in particular the impact of new technologies on the industry structure, processes and productivity. My current research focuses on the application and implementation of blockchain in the context of the built environment for lifecycle data management, supply chain integration, andÂ innovative forms of project governance.

I completed my doctorate (ETH, 2022) at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ic.ibi.ethz.ch/">Chair of Innovative and Industrial Construction</a> under the supervision of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://research.tudelft.nl/en/persons/daniel-hall">Daniel Hall</a> (now at TU Delft) on the potential of blockchain and cryptoeconomics in the construction industry. Prior to my doctorate, I obtained a MSc in civil engineering with areas of specialization in construction management and geotechnical engineering (ETH, 2017). I also completed the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://unitech-international.org/">UNITECH International</a> programme with an exchange semester of business studies (Trinity College Dublin, 2016) and worked in both civil engineering and supply chain management in the private sector.

In addition, I work at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://asvz.ch/sport/45680-manege">ASVZ</a> as a sports coach for gymnastics.
